/-! # FX intrinsic syntax.

Well-scoped intrinsic encoding (Allais–McBride style): `Ty` is indexed
by scope size (`Nat`), `Ctx` carries the actual binding types and is
indexed by mode + scope, and `Term` is indexed by context + type so
that the constructor signatures *are* the typing rules.  This sidesteps
Lean 4's strict-positivity rejection of the textbook Ty-mutually-with-
Ctx formulation that Agda accepts.

Contents, in dependency order:

  * `Ty` and the renaming / substitution algebra (`Ty.rename`,
    `Ty.subst`, plus identity / composition / commute laws).
  * `Ctx`, `varType`, and the intrinsic `Term` family.
  * `TermRenaming` / `TermSubst` and term-level `Term.rename`,
    `Term.weaken`, `Term.subst`, `Term.subst0`.
  * Functoriality witnesses (`Term.subst_id`, the closed-context
    cases of `Term.subst_weaken_commute_HEq`, and the pointwise-HEq
    machinery the binder cases need).
  * Reduction relations: `Step` (single-step β/η/ι), `StepStar`
    (multi-step), and `Conv` (definitional conversion), with full
    structural congruences for each. -/

/-! ## Types

Types are parameterised by their scope size — the number of free
variables they may reference.  v1.0 constructors do not actually
*use* the scope (no type variables, no dependent constructors), but
the index is required so that v1.2's `piTy` can ship a codomain at
scope `+1`. -/

/-- Types in a context with `scope` free variables.  v1.0+v1.2 has unit,
non-dependent `arrow`, and dependent `piTy`.  The `arrow` constructor is
a convenience for non-dependent function types where the codomain does
not reference the freshly-bound variable; `piTy` is the genuinely
dependent form where the codomain lives at scope `+1`. -/
inductive Ty : Nat → Type
  /-- The unit type — exists at every scope. -/
  | unit  : {scope : Nat} → Ty scope
  /-- Non-dependent function type.  Both domain and codomain live in
  the same scope; codomain cannot reference the freshly-bound variable.
  Kept as a separate constructor (rather than derived from `piTy` via
  weakening of the codomain) so that pattern matching against arrow is
  direct without needing to recognise a weakened-codomain `piTy`. -/
  | arrow : {scope : Nat} →
            (domain : Ty scope) →
            (codomain : Ty scope) →
            Ty scope
  /-- Dependent function type — codomain lives at scope `+1` and may
  reference the freshly-bound variable via `tyVar`. -/
  | piTy  : {scope : Nat} →
            (domain : Ty scope) →
            (codomain : Ty (scope + 1)) →
            Ty scope
  /-- Type-level variable reference — references the type at de Bruijn
  position `i` in the current scope.  This is what makes the
  substitution machinery actually *do* something: with `tyVar` in `Ty`,
  `Ty.subst` looks up the substituent for each variable instead of
  threading a placeholder.  v1.5+. -/
  | tyVar : {scope : Nat} → (index : Fin scope) → Ty scope
  /-- Dependent pair type — the second component's type may reference
  the first component via a tyVar in `codomain`.  Mirrors `piTy` in
  structure: codomain at scope `+1`.  v1.6+.

  Demonstrates the v1.4+ substitution discipline generalises: the
  exact same `Ty.subst0` machinery used by `appPi`'s result type also
  handles `pair`'s second-component type and `snd`'s eliminator. -/
  | sigmaTy : {scope : Nat} →
              (firstType : Ty scope) →
              (secondType : Ty (scope + 1)) →
              Ty scope
  /-- Boolean type — the smallest non-trivial inductive.  Adding `bool`
  exercises the "mechanical extension under a new Ty constructor"
  property: every Ty-recursive function gains a single `.bool` arm
  (returning `.bool` for renaming/substitution, `rfl` for the
  congruence/composition/identity theorems).  v1.13+. -/
  | bool : {scope : Nat} → Ty scope

/-! Decidable equality on `Ty` — auto-derives axiom-free because
`Ty`'s index is a bare `Nat`, so the discrimination obligations
are propext-free `Eq.rec` over an irrelevant motive. -/
deriving instance DecidableEq for Ty

/-! ## Renaming machinery.

`Renaming source target := Fin source → Fin target`.  `Ty.rename` is
defined first; `Ty.weaken` is then derived as `T.rename Renaming.weaken`
so binders stay binder-aware (the local `tyVar 0` is preserved by
`Renaming.lift`'s var-0 case). -/

/-- A renaming maps `Fin source` indices to `Fin target` indices.
The `Renaming source target` abbreviation makes scope explicit at
both ends, so when the lifted renaming threads through `Ty.rename`'s
recursion the indices line up definitionally. -/
abbrev Renaming (source target : Nat) : Type := Fin source → Fin target

/-- The identity renaming — every variable maps to itself. -/
def Renaming.identity {scope : Nat} : Renaming scope scope := id

/-- Weakening as a renaming — every variable shifts up by one. -/
def Renaming.weaken {scope : Nat} : Renaming scope (scope + 1) := Fin.succ

/-- Lift a renaming under a binder.  Variable 0 stays at 0; variable
`i + 1` maps to `(ρ i).succ`.  Crucially, the lifted renaming has
source `source + 1` *as a binder*, so when it threads into a recursive
call on a sub-term at scope `source + 1`, no Nat arithmetic is needed
to align the indices.

Implemented via direct match on the `Fin` structure (`⟨0, _⟩` /
`⟨k + 1, h⟩`) rather than `Fin.cases`, which itself uses `propext` in
core Lean — the empirical experiments at v1.4 confirmed this is the
critical difference. -/

/-- Apply a renaming to a type, structurally.  The `piTy` case lifts
the renaming under the new binder; the recursive call on the codomain
receives a renaming whose source scope is `source + 1` — definitionally
matching the codomain's scope.  No axioms required.

This is the more primitive operation; `Ty.weaken` is derived from it. -/

/-! ## Substitution — the same trick scaled up.

`Subst source target` is a function-typed family mapping `Fin source`
to `Ty target`.  Just as with `Renaming`, the substitution data carries
both endpoints as free parameters; lifting under a binder advances both
to `source + 1` and `target + 1`, definitionally matching the
recursive call's indices.

For v1.0+ `Ty` (no `Ty.tyVar` constructor), `Subst` is never *queried*
by `Ty.subst` — it threads through the recursion as a token.  When
v1.5+ adds `Ty.tyVar`, the `var` case will look up the substituent
via `σ`. -/

/-- Parallel substitution: each `Fin source` index maps to a `Ty target`
substituent.  Function-typed; `lift` advances source and target in
lockstep. -/
abbrev Subst (source target : Nat) : Type := Fin source → Ty target

/-- Lift a substitution under a binder.  Var 0 in the lifted scope is
the freshly-bound variable, represented as `Ty.tyVar 0`.  Var `k + 1`
is the original substituent for `k` weakened to the extended target
scope. -/

/-- Single-variable substitution at the outermost binder: substitute
`substituent` for var 0, leave var `k + 1` as `tyVar k` — the

input scope). -/

These lemmas turn `Subst` into a category enriched over `Ty`:

  * `Subst.identity` is the identity object.
  * `Subst.compose` (defined below the supporting weaken-commute lemma)

  * `Ty.subst` is the action of this category on `Ty`.

    of action) make the action functorial.

Together these say: substitution behaves algebraically. -/

/-! ## Contexts

`Ctx mode scope` is a typed context at the given mode containing
`scope`-many bindings.  Each binding carries its type *at the scope
that existed when it was bound* — so `cons context bindingType` extends
a `Ctx mode scope` with a `Ty scope`, and the result has scope
`scope + 1`. -/

/-- Typed contexts at a fixed mode, indexed by the number of bindings.
v1.0 is single-mode: every binding lives at the context's mode.  v1.5+
will introduce `lock` to cross modes via modalities. -/

  /-- The empty context at any mode. -/
  | nil  : (mode : Mode) → Ctx mode 0

           (bindingType : Ty scope) →
           Ctx mode (scope + 1)

/-! ## Variable resolution — v1.9 Fin-indexed.

The earlier `Lookup` family carried both the position and the looked-up
type as inductive indices, which forced `Term.rename` to pattern-match
on a `Lookup (Γ.cons newType) T` scrutinee — a cons-specialised Ctx
index.  Lean 4's match compiler emits `Ctx.noConfusion` for that shape,
which transitively pulls in `propext`.

The v1.9 design replaces `Lookup` with a `Fin scope` position plus a
type-computing function `varType`.  Pattern matches on `Fin` use the
direct `⟨0, _⟩` / `⟨k+1, h⟩` structural form (axiom-free per the project
binder-form discipline), and `varType`'s definition is itself
binder-form recursive over `Ctx` so it stays propext-free.  The type
the `Term.var` constructor produces is `varType context i`, computed by
the kernel definitionally rather than carried by an indexed inductive
witness. -/

/-- The type of variable `i` in context `Γ`.  Written as a binder-form
recursive function: each cons of `Γ` weakens its bound type by one to
live in the extended scope.  Variable `0` returns the head's weakened
type; variable `k + 1` recurses into the prefix.  Marked
`@[reducible]` so Lean's unifier unfolds it eagerly when checking
`Term.var` constructions and pattern matches. -/

/-! ## Terms

`Term context currentType` is a well-typed term in `context` of type
`currentType`.  Constructor signatures are the typing rules; Lean's
kernel checks each rule at declaration time, so a misstated rule is
rejected before any program is written using it. -/

`Fin scope` of `Γ`, the looked-up type at `ρ i` in `Δ` equals
`varType Γ i` after type-level renaming.  A `Prop` rather than a
`Type` so `Term.rename` can descend through the term without the
match compiler emitting `Ctx.noConfusion`. -/

with two contexts: at every position `i` of `Γ`, the looked-up type at

type-level implicits are propositionally equal and their value
arguments are HEq.  Building blocks for any inductive proof that
descends through `Term.subst` / `Term.rename` and needs to bridge

/-! ## `Term.rename_id_HEq`.

Renaming-side identity, the companion to `Term.subst_id_HEq` (v1.25):

  HEq (Term.rename (TermRenaming.identity Γ) t) t

Mirrors `Term.subst_id_HEq`'s 12-case structural induction.  Simpler
than the subst version because `TermRenaming` is `Prop`-valued —
the binder cases bridge `TermRenaming.lift (identity Γ) dom` against
`TermRenaming.identity (Γ.cons dom)` directly via
`Term.rename_HEq_pointwise` over `Renaming.lift_identity_equiv`,
without needing a separate `lift_identity_pointwise` stepping stone
(those existed for subst because TermSubst is Type-valued and pointwise
HEq on the witness is non-trivial).

Closed-context cases use the constructor HEq congruences plus
`Ty.rename_identity` at each Ty index.  Cast-bearing cases
(appPi/pair/snd) strip outer casts via `eqRec_heq`. -/

/-! ## `Term.rename_compose_HEq`.

Double-rename equals single-rename by composed renaming, modulo HEq.
The two sides have types `Term Γ₃ ((T.rename ρ₁).rename ρ₂)` and
`Term Γ₃ (T.rename (Renaming.compose ρ₁ ρ₂))`; these agree
propositionally by `Ty.rename_compose`.  Pattern-matched structural
induction on the term.

Binder cases bridge `TermRenaming.lift (compose ρt₁ ρt₂) dom` against

`Term.rename_HEq_pointwise` over `Renaming.lift_compose_equiv`. -/

/-! ## `Term.rename_weaken_commute_HEq`.

Term-level analogue of `Ty.rename_weaken_commute`:

  Term.rename (lift ρt X) (Term.weaken X t)
    ≃HEq≃
  Term.weaken (X.rename ρ) (Term.rename ρt t)

Both sides factor into double-rename forms because `Term.weaken X t`
is `Term.rename (TermRenaming.weaken Γ X) t`.  By v1.37 each side
collapses to a single rename along a composed TermRenaming; the two
underlying renamings (`compose Renaming.weaken ρ.lift` and `compose
ρ Renaming.weaken`) are pointwise equal — both reduce to `Fin.succ ∘ ρ`
modulo Fin proof-irrelevance.  The bridge is `Term.rename_HEq_pointwise`
(v1.36) over the trivial pointwise witness. -/

12-case structural induction on the term.  Closed-context cases

against `lift (renameAfter σt ρt) dom` via `Term.subst_HEq_pointwise`

/-! ## `Term.subst_weaken_commute_HEq`.

Term-level analogue of `Ty.subst_weaken_commute`:

  Term.subst (σt.lift X) (Term.weaken X t)
    ≃HEq≃
  Term.weaken (X.subst σ) (Term.subst σt t)

Direct corollary of v1.40 + v1.42 — no fresh structural induction.
Both sides factor into rename/subst forms (since `Term.weaken X t`
is `Term.rename (TermRenaming.weaken Γ X) t`).  v1.42 collapses
LHS to `Term.subst (precompose (weaken Γ X) (σt.lift X)) t`; v1.40
collapses RHS to `Term.subst (renameAfter σt (weaken Δ (X.subst σ))) t`.
The two underlying Substs (`precompose Renaming.weaken σ.lift` and
`renameAfter σ Renaming.weaken`) are pointwise rfl-equal — both
reduce to `(σ i).weaken`.  `Term.subst_HEq_pointwise` (v1.24)
bridges them.

This subsumes the v1.28–v1.33 standalone closed-context case
lemmas (`Term.subst_weaken_commute_HEq_{var,unit,boolTrue,boolFalse,
app,boolElim,fst,snd,pair,appPi}`); the binder cases (`lam`,
`lamPi`) that were missing in those layered theorems are now
covered by the same corollary.  Mirrors v1.38 exactly. -/

/-! ## `TermSubst.lift_compose_pointwise` (full theorem).

Lifting commutes with TermSubst composition pointwise (HEq).  Position 0
delegates to the existing `lift_compose_pointwise_zero` fragment.
Position `k + 1` is the substantive case:

  * LHS at `k+1`: `outer_subst_weaken_commute.symm ▸ Term.weaken
    (newType.subst (Subst.compose σ₁ σ₂)) (Ty.subst_compose ...
    ▸ Term.subst σt₂ (σt₁ k'))`.

  * RHS at `k+1`: `outer_subst_compose ▸ Term.subst (σt₂.lift
    (newType.subst σ₁)) ((Ty.subst_weaken_commute ...).symm ▸
    Term.weaken (newType.subst σ₁) (σt₁ k'))`.

The RHS inner reduces, via `Term.subst_HEq_cast_input` + v1.43
`Term.subst_weaken_commute_HEq`, to `Term.weaken ((newType.subst
σ₁).subst σ₂) (Term.subst σt₂ (σt₁ k'))`.  The two `Term.weaken`
forms differ only by `Ty.subst_compose newType σ₁ σ₂` on the
`newType` and the per-position analogue on the inner type;
`Term.weaken_HEq_congr` closes via `eqRec_heq`. -/

/-! ## `Term.subst_compose`.

The cap-stone of substitution functoriality at the term level:

  Term.subst σt₂ (Term.subst σt₁ t)
    ≃HEq≃
  Term.subst (TermSubst.compose σt₁ σt₂) t

Both sides have type `Term Γ₃ T'` for propositionally-equal `T'`s
(`((T.subst σ₁).subst σ₂)` vs `T.subst (Subst.compose σ₁ σ₂)`,
bridged by `Ty.subst_compose`).  HEq carries the difference.

12-case structural induction on the term.

  * Closed-context cases (var, unit/boolTrue/boolFalse, app, fst,
    boolElim) combine constructor HEq congruences with
    `Ty.subst_compose` at each Ty index.
  * Cast-bearing cases (appPi/pair/snd) peel outer casts via
    `eqRec_heq` and push inner casts through
    `Term.subst_HEq_cast_input`.  The sigmaTy/piTy second-component
    bridge chains `Ty.subst_compose` at scope+1 with
    `Subst.lift_compose_equiv`.
  * Binder cases (lam, lamPi) recurse via the IH at lifted
    TermSubsts (`lift σt₁ dom` and `lift σt₂ (dom.subst σ₁)`),
    then bridge `compose (lift σt₁) (lift σt₂)` against
    `lift (compose σt₁ σt₂)` via `Term.subst_HEq_pointwise` (v1.24)
    over `TermSubst.lift_compose_pointwise` (v1.44).

Mirrors v1.40 / v1.42 with subst on both sides instead of mixed
subst+rename. -/

/-! ## Categorical-structure laws on TermSubst (pointwise HEq).

Term-level analogues of the Ty-level monoid laws (`Subst.compose_*`).
Together with `Term.subst_id` (v1.25) and `Term.subst_compose` (v1.45)
they establish `(Ty, TermSubst, Term.subst)` as a category enriched
over `Ty` at the term level — identity is unital on both sides and
composition is associative.  Stated as pointwise HEq (per Fin position)
because `TermSubst` is Type-valued and per-position values can have
propositionally-distinct types between LHS and RHS. -/

/-- Composing the identity TermSubst on the left leaves a TermSubst
pointwise unchanged.  At each position, LHS is
`outer_cast ▸ Term.subst σt (inner_cast.symm ▸ Term.var i)`; cast
through `Term.subst_HEq_cast_input` and the var arm of `Term.subst`
collapses to `σt i`. -/

/-! ## Typed reduction (`Step`, `StepStar`).

`Step t₁ t₂` is `Prop`-valued and shares its `{ctx} {T}` indices
between sides — so subject reduction is **structural**: every
`Step` proof produces a same-typed reduct by signature alone, no
preservation theorem needed.  Covers congruence, β (`betaApp`,
`betaAppPi`), Σ projections (`betaFstPair`, `betaSndPair`),
η contractions, and boolean ι rules. -/
